## LED Patterns


- **Snake**: left to right, then reversed. Like a slithering snake.


- **Double Snake**: same as snake, but starts on opposite ends, and pattern meets in the middle.


- **Broken Light**: simulate a broken light - not really useful or cool, but mildly interesting.

## Hardware
- ATtiny85
- 220 ohm resistors
- Copper wire - 16 AWG
- White LEDs
- Coin cell housing
- CR2032

## Problems That Occurred
- I soldered one LED out of order, so the blink patterns look a little off
- 16 awg copper wire is very difficult to solder. It wasn't heating up well enough to make a good joint
- It was difficult to straighten out the resistor leads if you made a mistake. There was only one chance to get it right
